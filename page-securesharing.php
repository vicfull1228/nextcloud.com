        <p class="section--paragraph">Forrester urges senior corporate management and IT professionals to shift away from ad-hoc solutions like email, outdated technologies like FTP or customer-grade file sync and share like Dropbox. Key requirements they identify for a solution include:
        <ul>
            <li>Enterprise-grade security, with governance and policies to protect valuable content and code</li>
            <li>Ease of use, working in familiar apps such as email to avoid disruption and adoption challenges</li>
            <li>APIs for integration with engineering, support desk, and other essential work processes</li>
        </ul>
        The goal should be to streamline productivity without sacrificing visibility into the distribution of digital knowledge assets.</p>

            <h3>Concerns about new technologies</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">A key concern cited by 72% of the respondents is the creation of new content silos. Having to migrate data and manage it in a new location, the goals of simplifying work flows while strengthening governance will not be achieved.</p>
            <h3>Current 'solution': email</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">Over half of the teams managed by respondents is reported to use public, consumer grade file sharing services and email to share code, patches and other intellectual property within the organization as well as with customers. Forrester notes that these solutions neither protect intellectual property and competitive advantage but also offer little control or rights management, nor audit and tracking controls.

            <p class="section--paragraph">Modern organizations have data in a wide variety of silos like Sharepoint, Windows Network Drives, FTP sites and (often without knowledge of management) Dropbox or Google Drive.

            <h2>Designed for the real world</h2>
            <p class="section--paragraph">Users can access data on a FTP drive shared with another company; while data stored on an external object storage could be encrypted using server-side encryption so the storage provider has no way to compromise their security.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">Meanwhile, files from the HR department are always enforced to be end-to-end encrypted on their clients, protecting their files from even the worst case of a full server breach.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">The layered approach to security makes sure users have the maximum amount of productivity in their web interface while making sure sensitive data receives the ultimate protection, client-to-client. Keeping it all in a single solution simplifies management and avoids mistakes from users or IT departments that might cause costly data leaks.</p>
