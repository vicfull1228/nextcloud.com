<h2><?php echo $l->t('Design guidelines');?></h2>
<ul>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Software should work. Only put features into master when they are complete. It is better to not have a feature instead of having one that works poorly.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Software should get out of the way. Do things automatically instead of offering configuration options.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Software should be easy to use. Show only the most important elements. Secondary elements only on hover or via »Advanced« function.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('People’s data is sacred. Provide undo instead of asking for confirmation – <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning/">which might be dismissed</a>.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('The state of the application should be clear. If something loads, provide feedback.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Do not adapt broken concepts (for example design of desktop apps) just for the sake of »consistency«. We provide a better interface.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Regularly reset your installation to see what the first-run experience is like. And improve it.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Ideally do <a href="http://jancborchardt.net/usability-in-free-software">usability testing</a> to know how people use the software.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('When people ask for features, find out what the root of the problem is. Then fix that instead of just adding a feature.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Test in different browsers. We need to fully support the common browsers like Firefox and Chrome as well as Internet Explorer down to version 8.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Test on different devices. The web interface should work on a smartphone or tablet as well as it does on desktop.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('For further UX principles, read <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/quantifying-usability">Alex Faaborg from Mozilla</a>.');?></li>

<h2><?php echo $l->t('More concrete HTML+CSS guidelines');?></h2>
<ul>

		<ul>
			<li><?php echo $l->t('Use tabs for indentation, not spaces');?></li>
			<li><?php echo $l->t('Sorting of declarations should be sensically grouped instead of alphabetized. First positioning and sizes, then typography, then colors, then additional rules.');?></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('HTML and CSS building blocks are in <a href="https://doc.nextcloud.org/server/8.0/developer_manual/app/css.html">the documentation</a>.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('Clickable elements should be a minimum of 44*44px to be easily tappable on mobile devices and well visible on desktop. See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/LayoutandAppearance.html">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a> for reference.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('We don’t use SASS or another preprocessor because of the barrier to entry.');?></li>
	<li><?php echo $l->t('We don’t use Bootstrap because there’s lots of parts we don’t need and we would need to customize a lot anyway. We do use pieces of Bootstrap though, like Tipsy for tooltips.');?></li>
