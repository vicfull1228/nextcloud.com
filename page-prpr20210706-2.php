<h1>IONOS partners with Nextcloud to offer UK SMEs comprehensive cloud storage</h1>
<h3>Complete data sovereignty and European data protection / Managed operation for easier maintenance / Flexible and easy to adapt to a business’s needs</h3>
<p><em>Karlsruhe/London, July 06, 2021</em> - IONOS, Europe’s largest cloud hosting and services provider, is now offering UK companies Managed Nextcloud – a professional cloud storage solution that enables collaborative working for small businesses, agencies and self-employed professionals. The GDPR-compliant solution guarantees efficient teamwork in accordance with strict European data protection standards, while enabling maximum flexibility when storing, managing and editing data collaboratively. Managed Nextcloud allows businesses to store files like documents, contacts and photos and offers better collaboration through file syncing across devices, while IONOS handles the administration and maintenance.</p>
<p>The companies began working together to help ensure sovereignty of customer data. As both businesses are based in Europe, this eliminates potential data compliance issues with the US CLOUD Act. The US legislation that requires US cloud providers to disclose customers’ data upon request, regardless of where it’s stored and irrespective of GDPR. By partnering with another European provider, IONOS and Nextcloud are helping to ensure SMEs and business owners have protection against this legislation while hosting their data securely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important for companies not to lose control of their own data when collaborating online, and to be able to quickly and easily adapt their working environment to their own needs. With Managed Nextcloud, we offer our customers tailored cloud storage that meets these requirements,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>commented Achim Weiss, CEO of IONOS.</p>
<p>Key benefits of Managed Nextcloud include:</p>
<h2>Quick integration</h2>
<p>Nextcloud is hosted on IONOS systems and pre-installed, meaning there is easy integration between the two hosting solutions. Users do not have to install new cloud platform software if they are already using IONOS services.</p>
<h2>Collaboration and easy maintenance</h2>
<p>Colleagues and business partners can collaborate via a central platform while IONOS experts take care of updates, security and operation. Data is automatically synchronised on all devices, and can be accessed anytime and anywhere. With advanced rights management, files and documents can easily be shared and managed. Additionally, companies can individualise their cloud storage with a personalised URL and their company logo – allowing for a professional presence across all platforms.</p>
<h2>Apps to extend Nextcloud as required</h2>
<p>The collaboration solution offers many customisation options through an integrated open source app store. The applications and extensions include team calendars and address books, email connection, a document editor and a Kanban board. In addition, the integrated Talk app enables online meetings, video conferencing and screen sharing directly in the users’ personalised cloud. This means that all data, conversations and content remain secure and confidential.</p>
<h2>Data protection and complete data sovereignty</h2>
<p>Managed Nextcloud meets the highest security standards in accordance with European data protection law, with data stored exclusively in European data centers . Access rights can be defined individually and activities can be tracked and logged in accordance with compliance guidelines, to ensure privacy and confidentiality where needed. Other safety features include antivirus scanning with an antivirus app, two-factor authentication and NIST compliant password policy control functionalities.
