<h1>Nextcloud introduces one-click migration from privacy-unfriendly public cloud platforms</h1>
<h3>Easy migration from Google services, Dropbox and OneDrive lowers barrier to entry for self-hosted cloud</h3>
<p><em>Stuttgart, December 16, 2020</em> - Nextcloud GmbH, the company behind the worlds’ most deployed on-premises content collaboration platform, announces availability of easy migration apps for Nextcloud users looking to move from popular proprietary cloud services to a private cloud platform. Files will be automatically transferred to Nextcloud and import of calendar, contacts and other data is available for some of the migrations.</p>
<p>With the continuing stream of privacy violations, sudden and disruptive changes in policy like the with Google Photos, and abandoned services like Google News, it has become widely recognized that the digital sovereignty offered by an open source, self-hosted platform provides countless benefits to users. Unfortunately the barrier to self-hosting services is steep for many non-technical users. Nextcloud has been on the forefront of lowering this barrier, with its unique Simple Signup which provides users with a 5gb free storage Nextcloud account at a local, reliable hosting provider in under 30 seconds. The recent Nextcloud 20 release decreased the pain of dealing with heterogeneous environments where Slack, Matrix, Teams, SharePoint and other technologies are used by introducing powerful integrations with those platforms. The introduction of easy data migration tools for Nextcloud today further lowers this all-important barrier to use.</p>
<blockquote>To truly change the dynamics of the internet and the massive privacy violations that have become core to the business model of many internet giants, alternatives have to challenge them in capabilities and ease of use. Migration needs to be seamless before the vast majority of people are able to move and adopt privacy-friendly solutions. Today we make a big step forward in that regard.</blockquote>
<p>-- Jan-Christoph Borchardt, design lead at Nextcloud GmbH</p>
<p>The migrations include Google migration, where calendars, contacts, photos, files from Drive and documents from Google Docs are seamlessly migrated into their respective Nextcloud services. Moreover, users of Google Photos are recommended Nextcloud apps like Maps and Facerecognition to replace their current platform. For Dropbox, file import is available, preserving directory structure. Microsoft OneDrive users can also migrate file and folder structure, with other data migration options on our roadmap. On request of many users, our migration path from ownCloud was also updated to move directly to the latest Nextcloud 20 release.</p>
<blockquote>These migration services are a great win for the data sovereignty of consumers all over the world. Millions of users have access to Nextcloud servers and we look forward to many more to sign up at a provider or set up their own server. We expect many hosting providers do enable these apps for their users, easing their way into a private, secure alternative.</blockquote>
<p>-- Andreas Rode, Chief Commercial Officer at Nextcloud GmbH</p>
