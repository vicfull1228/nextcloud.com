        <h2>Local Path Disclosure when using Asset Pipeline (oC-SA-2014-021)</h2>
        <p>25th November 2014</p>
        <p>Risk level: <strong>Low</strong></p>
        
        
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><p>Nextcloud 7 introduced the so-called "Asset Pipeline". It is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting asset-pipeline.enabled to true in config.php</p>
<p>When the setting is enabled Nextcloud concatenates all CSS and JS files into a single large blob file. Thus the amount of initial required requests to the Nextcloud instance is lower and therefore the instance is loaded faster.</p>
<p>The generated files are stored on the local filesystem and use a filename that is generated by hashing the original CSS and JS absolute file paths using MD5.</p>
<p>Therefore, an attacker could perform a brute-force attack to gain the information under which path (e.g. <code>/var/www/nextcloud/</code>) the Nextcloud instance was installed.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Affected Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nextcloud Server &lt; <strong>7.0.3</strong> (CVE-2014-9044)</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Action Taken</h3>
        <p><p>The filename is now generated by using relative file paths to the Nextcloud installation. Therefore an attacker cannot brute-force the absolute paths anymore.</p>
</p>
