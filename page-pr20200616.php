<h1>Nextcloud Mail introduces Machine Learning for Priority Inbox</h1>
<p><em>June 16 2020, Stuttgart</em> - Nextcloud GmbH, the company behind the worlds’ most deployed on-premises content collaboration platform, announces the introduction of a priority inbox in Nextcloud Mail. As part of a continued investment in artificial intelligence and smart features, the Priority Inbox uses machine learning to classify important messages as such and shows mail sorted into the categories important, favorites and others. Unlike approaches employed by public cloud services, the learning happens locally and only uses the data from individual users to protect their privacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The benefits of machine learning in day to day use of software are becoming more apparent. Unfortunately most uses of machine learning operate on user data without much regard for privacy. Nextcloud’s implementation works fully locally and protects the privacy of its user. We are proud to be leading in the on-premises collaboration space in employing the capabilities of Machine learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- Frank Karlitschek, CEO of Nextcloud GmbH</p>
<p>The Priority inbox separates messages into important, favorite and other messages. This allows the user a more efficient way to sort and find what matters in their inbox, even when they are flooded with large amounts of email.</p>
<p>The priority inbox builds on the introduction of a message cache, improving performance of the Mail app for users especially on slow or very basic IMAP servers. A machine learning model is trained on emails, looking at whom the user emails with frequently and other factors. Over time, the model learns from the classification of emails as important by the user, improving the accuracy of the Priority Inbox. This release of Mail also introduces multi-select, improved search and other user interface and interaction changes.</p>
<p>The intelligent sorting in the inbox adds to Nextcloud’s other smart features like showing relevant documents or contacts users are likely to want to share with or detecting suspicious logins.</p>
