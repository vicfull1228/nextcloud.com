<h1>Nextcloud and Struktur offer easy 30 day trial and integrated signup for hosted HPB in Talk 10</h1>
<p><em>New release dramatically lowers barrier for organizations looking for scaleable video conferencing without the complications of running their own high performance back-end</em></p>
<p><em>Stuttgart, October 3, 2020</em> - Nextcloud GmbH and Struktur AG today release an offering for organizations looking to have easy video conferencing with large number of participants without having to host a resource-intensive connection back-end themselves. By integrating the sign-up process in Nextcloud Talk 10, offering a 30 days free trial and making configuration entirely automatic, a productive video conferencing has become dramatically easier to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>There continues to be a great demand for secure video conferencing, and with an easy, integrated registration process in Nextcloud Talk, we are able to provide a privacy-compliant, unified communications platform that is 100% compliant with regional general data protection regulations.</blockquote>
<p>-- Niels Mache, CEO Struktur AG</p>
<p>Nextcloud Talk is ideal for audio/video meetings and chat and available in the browser or mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Nextcloud Talk comes with an easy to install and zero-configuration, PHP-based server back-end offering peer-to-peer audio/video connectivity. This typically limits individual meetings and conferences to 4-10 people as bandwidth requirements scale with the number of participants.</p>
<p>To allow more participants, the open source High Performance Back-end (HPB) offered by Struktur solves this bottleneck by forwarding streams on demand. This scales to about 30-50 active participants, with special features for webinars and large-scale broadcasts up to hundreds or thousands of participants. The back-end also reduces the load of calls on the server and can be configured for customers to connect to SIP gates for dial-in by telephone.</p>
<p>The high performance back-end requires separate configuration and setup on multiple distinct, high-performance, high-bandwidth physical servers directly connected to the internet without firewall. Alternatively, Struktur AG offers a high performance back-end service that optimally meets individual capacity requirements.</p>
<p>With Nextcloud Talk 10, signing up to a trial to the high Performance Back-end service from Struktur AG requires just one click from the administrator settings. The server will be configured automatically and once the trial is finished, users can sign up to the paid service or just end the trial.</p>
