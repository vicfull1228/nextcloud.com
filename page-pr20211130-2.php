<h1>Nextcloud Hub II re-decentralizes the cloud with easy to deploy All-in-one container and peer-to-peer backup</h1>
<p><em>New deployment, backup technologies enable further growth of decentralized collaboration as a counter-model to Big Tech’s attempts to control user data</em></p>
<p><em>Berlin, November 30, 2021</em> - Nextcloud, the market-leading on-premises cloud collaboration vendor, introduces technologies to fuel further decentralization of cloud data away from Big Tech platforms. An All-in-one Docker image designed for deployment in Gaia-X and other decentralized cloud environments decreases the barrier to access, while a peer-to-peer Backup application enables easy small-scale, user-to-user backup. Integration of Solid, the WWW-inventors’ privacy initiative, also reached a milestone with real-world-deployments starting to roll out.</p>
<p>Nextcloud’s bold moves come as the demand for digitally sovereign, privacy-respecting solutions is skyrocketing. Over 70% of computer users are searching to increase their online privacy and enterprises consider data privacy and confidentiality their most important concern only behind data loss. Besides a significant uptake of Nextcloud in business and government, these concerns have also resulted in the deployment of hundreds of thousands of privately operated Nextcloud servers from small and medium businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>There is however a significant barrier, as running a small server takes skills and users rightly worry about potential data loss when a server experiences problems. Lowering this barrier with easy cloud deployments and peer-to-peer backup will enable orders of magnitude more small and medium businesses to escape the clutches of Big Tech and regain control over their data.</p>
<p>The All-in-one Docker image adds an option to the existing hosting solutions which already serve millions of Nextcloud users, giving users more control over their private cloud in exchange for a small amount of maintenance. It automates configuration of web servers, databases and other underlying technology while offering the entire range of Nextcloud Hub II functionality out of the box. This includes the high-performance back-ends for Files and Talk. It provides an easy administrator interface from where individual services, ran as separate containers, can be managed.</p>
<p>The peer-to-peer backup solution Nextcloud Backup is designed to help private users store a backup of their Nextcloud instance on another Nextcloud server operated by a friend or family member. Backups are compressed and encrypted and users can restore either individual files or their entire instance using an encryption key ideally stored off-site. Alternatively, the Backup app can store its data snapshots on any supported External Storage in Nextcloud like (s)FTP, SMB, SharePoint, WebDAV or S3 object storage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nextcloud is committed to providing its users 100% control over their data, something which provides near universal benefit for government agencies, businesses and individuals. Nextcloud Hub II is precisely what many modern organizations need and we expect a quick uptake and accelerated growth of our community and customer base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- Frank Karlitschek, CEO at Nextcloud GmbH</p>
<p>Together with the availability of new, easy deployment and backup solutions for Nextcloud Hub II, Nextcloud partners at PDS Interop have readied an update for the Solid server integration for Nextcloud aimed at wider deployment of this technology. The Solid project, conceived by WWW-founder Sir Tim Berners-Lee, is a new web standard for decentralized storage of data in so-called Pods. Nextcloud can act as a storage Pod, giving users the ability to connect to other apps in the developing Solid ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be that the way Solid takes off is that it starts off with all the Nextcloud users just becoming Solid users. That bootstrap could be a very important part of the way Solid takes off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Solid Director, at Solid World April</p>
<p>Nextcloud’s All-in-one cloud image, Nextcloud Backup and the Solid Pod app are all available right now with the release of Nextcloud Hub II.</p>
