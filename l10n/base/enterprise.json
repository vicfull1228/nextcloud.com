Today it is a widely used and broadly accepted license across various stakeholders, including developers, users, organizations and large enterprises. The AGPLv3 guarantees that all users of the software can use, study, share and improve the software without any legal risks. Further its patent clause ensures all users have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license on any patents owned by code contributors now or in the future.

Note that configuration does not count as modification!
