    "Nextcloud Proxy is both an app inside Nextcloud and a service. The Nextcloud Proxy app is installed in Nextcloud and configured in the Nextcloud admin panel. From the Nextcloud Proxy app, an admin can sign up for an Nextcloud Proxy account with one of the supported providers. Once the account is confirmed, the Nextcloud app initiates and maintains a secure connection to the Nextcloud Proxy service. The service in turn provides a recognizable URL on the web that, when accessed via Nextcloud clients, connects users back to their Nextcloud server residing behind their router on a network at home or at work. Once the server is connected, simply download the desktop sync client from Nextcloud.org, or get the Nextcloud apps from the Apple App Store or Google Play, and get started.": "Nextcloud Proxy is both an app inside Nextcloud and a service.
