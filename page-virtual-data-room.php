Forrester notes that these solutions neither protect intellectual property and competitive advantage but also offer little control or rights management, nor audit and tracking controls.</p>
            <p class="section--paragraph">And indeed, the McAfee survey shows data loss and theft occur regularly. Change is needed.</p>
            <h3>Concerns about new technologies</h3>
            <p class="section--paragraph">But introducing a new technology can be disruptive. A key concern cited by 72% of the respondents is the creation of new content silos. Having to migrate data and manage it in a new location, the goals of simplifying work flows while strengthening governance will not be achieved.</p>

            <p class="section--paragraph">The layered approach to security makes sure users have the maximum amount of productivity in their web interface while making sure sensitive data receives the ultimate protection, client-to-client. Keeping it all in a single solution simplifies management and avoids mistakes from users or IT departments that might cause costly data leaks.</p>
