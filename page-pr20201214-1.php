<h1>Hancom and Nextcloud announce Strategic Partnership</h1>
<h3>By integrating Hancom Office Online, Nextcloud adds Office-compatible content creation tools and real time co-authoring capabilities</h3>

<p><em>SEATTLE, Dec. 14, 2020</em> -  Hancom and Nextcloud today announced a strategic partnership that will result in the integration of the Hancom Office suite of professional-grade productivity and collaboration tools for Nextcloud users. This integration enables organizations around the world whose data privacy or regulatory requirements have precluded them from taking full advantage of the most modern cloud-based productivity and collaboration services to access a suite of modern content creation tools and real-time collaboration services without compromising privacy or data location rules.</p>

<p>Nextcloud users in multiple locations can use the built-in text- and video-chat features of Hancom Office while concurrently reviewing, commenting, and co-editing Office documents, spreadsheets, and multimedia presentations. The privacy and security features for which Nextcloud is known ensure the security and integrity of content created and updated using Hancom Office within the Nextcloud environment.</p>

<p>Both companies strongly believe in putting the customer and user firmly in control. SuiteCRM and Nextcloud are released under open source licenses allowing users to protect their digital sovereignty and have the freedom to host on-premise or opt for cloud hosting.</p>

<blockquote>We're excited to work closely with Nextcloud to integrate the power of Hancom Office and the security of Nextcloud,</blockquote>
<p>says Dr. Wonsok Yun, President of Global Business at Hancom Group. </p>
<blockquote>For too long, too many organizations have had to choose between using the most modern office applications and ensuring the security and privacy of their data—but now that time is over. The integration of Hancom Office and Nextcloud ensures that Nextcloud Enterprise customers can take advantage of professional-grade, Office-compatible content creation and collaboration tools from Hancom—and do so in a manner that is protected by the privacy and data management features of Nextcloud.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For Nextcloud customers, our strategic relationship with Hancom fills a critical space,</blockquote>
<p>Frank Karlitschek, Founder and CEO at Nextcloud GmbH said: </p>
<blockquote>There has been great demand for an office productivity solution as mature or as feature-rich as Hancom Office. Many enterprises require an office productivity suite that offers the degree of Microsoft Office compatibility that Hancom Office does, while offering the familiar interface they expect. Thanks to Hancom Office, users can open, simultaneously co-edit from multiple locations and devices, and then save documents in native Office formats with ease—in the secure environment created by Nextcloud.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hancom Office and Nextcloud integration scenarios</strong></p>
<p>Nextcloud users can work with different editions of Hancom Office, ensuring that different users with different needs and preferences can take advantage of the Hancom Office and Nextcloud integration. </p>
<p>Hancom Office Online will enable users to create and collaborate on content from any location and any device through a browser window. Hancom Office 2020, which now includes Hancom Mail—a full-featured email client that offers a viable alternative to Outlook—will enable Nextcloud users to create and edit content from a traditional desktop or laptop device. Hancom Office Mobile, already installed on more than 500M devices, will enable Nextcloud users to access their content and collaborate using a mobile or tablet device running Android, iOS, or ChromeOS. </p>
<p><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong></p>
<p>Hancom Office integration with Nextcloud will be rolling out in Q1 2021. Pricing has yet to be announced. </p>
