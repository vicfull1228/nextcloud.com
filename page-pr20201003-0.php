<p>-- Frank Karlitschek, CEO and founder of Nextcloud GmbH</p>
<p>The global health crisis has accelerated the need for powerful online communication technology but the haphazard deployments have splintered collaboration within and between organizations and introduced a dizzying array of compliance and data loss risks for IT departments. Nextcloud Hub not only empowers organizations to consolidate their collaboration into a single, secure, on-premises platform but also introduces a range of integrations with internal and external tools operated by an organizations’ supliers, partners and customers.Nextcloud Hub 20 offers a more integrated experience by bringing in information across a range of platforms, allowing users to react faster to new tasks, avoid context switching and plan their time more effectively.</p>
<p>Nextcloud Hub 20 builds on an open API, the Open Collaboration Services, making integration efforts transparent and well documented. The release introduces over 3 dozen integrations with a wide range of solutions. * Bridges are introduced between the Nextcloud Talk chat service with Microsoft Teams, Slack, Matrix, IRC, XMPP, Steam and many more. * Nextcloud’s integrated, unified search can provide results from ticketing systems like Jira and Zammad, development platforms like Github and Gitlab, e-learning systems like Moodle, forums like Discourse and Reddit, social media like Twitter and Mastodon and more.</p>
