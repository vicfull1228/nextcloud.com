<h1>Nextcloud becomes an integration platform with Microsoft, Google, Slack, Moodle, Github, HPI School-Cloud, Jira, Dropbox, Matrix and more</h1>
<p><em>Focus on integrating thrid party platforms announced at Nextcloud Conference</em></p>
<p><em>October 3, 2020, Berlin</em> - Nextcloud GmbH, provider of the most deployed on-premises content collaboration platform announces a shift towards deeper integration with third party platforms and the results of the first efforts in this direction. Integrations in Nextcloud 20 include dominant solutions like Slack, MS Online Office Server, SharePoint and Teams, Jira and Github as well as open source contenders like Matrix, Gitlab, Zammad and Moodle among many others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nextcloud has become the central communication and document exchange hub for many organizations. Integration with third party solutions deployed at our customers or their partners, suppliers and customers will further improve their productivity and facilitate collaboration within and across organizational boundaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- Frank Karlitschek, CEO and founder of Nextcloud GmbH</p>
<p>Since its inception Nextcloud differentiated itself as a solution capable of unlocking the many storage silos in modern organizations, bringing data from SharePoint, FTP, Windows Network Drive, Object Storage and other solutions in a single interface without forcing costly data migration. Integrating in existing security and authentication infrastructure, Nextcloud successfully sped up deployment and improved productivity at thousands of businesses.</p>
<p>With a growing array of often SaaS based solutions, the kind and number of data storages has exploded, adding chat channels, planning tools, and more into a dizzying compliance and data loss risk factor for system administrators. The global health crisis has compounded this problem, with improved adoption of online communication tools splintering collaboration in and between organizations further. With Nextcloud 20 a wide range of new integration features debuts, connecting Nextcloud to many different platforms from third party vendors. This creates a more integrated experience for users, allowing them to react faster to new tasks, avoid context switching and plan their time more effectively.</p>
<p>Nextcloud Hub 20 builds on an open API, the Open Collaboration Services, making integration efforts transparent and well documented. The release introduces over 3 dozen integrations with a wide range of solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bridges are introduced between the Nextcloud Talk chat service with Microsoft Teams, Slack, Matrix, IRC, XMPP, Steam and many more.</li>
<li>Nextcloud’s integrated, unified search can provide results from ticketing systems like Jira and Zammad, development platforms like Github and Gitlab, e-learning systems like Moodle and HPI, forums like Discourse and Reddit, social media like Twitter and Mastodon and more. </li>
<li>Nextcloud Talk can call external applications through commands and a new Webhooks Flow integration enables third party platform activities to trigger or be triggered by the Nextcloud workflow capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>With GitLab, customers get a complete CI/CD and security toolchain in a single application that spans the entire software development lifecycle,</blockquote>
<p>said Brandon Jung, VP of alliances at GitLab.</p>
<blockquote>It is great to see an open source project like Nextcloud integrate with GitLab, providing value to our shared customers and users across the globe. The power of open source is deep integration and collaboration, and this development is a great example of that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With this Nextcloud partnership, Hancom will bring Hancom Office Online, its flagship cloud-based office productivity application into the world’s most popular on-premise content collaboration platform. Together, Hancom and Nextcloud will be able to create the optimized user experience for viewing, editing, creating Office files. In addition, this cooperation can offer market-leading software solutions that leverage the power of the Internet and provide users with a consistent, unified and productive experience regardless of computing platform</blockquote>
<p>-- Dr. Won Sok Yun, President of Hancom Group</p>

<blockquote>The crisis has increased the need for online collaboration solutions and Nextcloud and Moodle are extremely popular in the educational space. An expansion of our integration as initially developed in 2017 is set to benefit millions of students and teachers.</blockquote>
<p>-- Martin Dougiamas, Founder/CEO at Moodle Pty Ltd.</p>

<blockquote>Zammad enables users to manage tasks and incoming customer requests. Open source, self-hosted cloud technologies allow networking and integration with each other. Nextcloud and Zammad complement each other and integration provides users with improved productivity.</blockquote>
<p>-- Martin Edenhofer, Founder and CEO at Zammad GmbH</p>

<blockquote>Imagine a invoice generated by the accounting system triggering a conversion of a word document to a PDF file in Nextcloud through Webhooks Flow and, in turn, creating a chat message with public link to the PDF via a Talk bridge into a Slack channel of the customer. The account manager can receive a push notification on their mobile device when the invoice payment comes in, or see it the next morning when they log into Nextcloud on their Dashboard and respond with a Talk command to mark the invoice paid in the accounting system. The opportunities to optimize workflows at our customers are endless.</blockquote>
<p>-- Andreas Rode, head of sales at Nextcloud GmbH</p>
<p>Together with its partners, Nextcloud has released a series of press releases covering some of the integrations developed, including Moodle, HPI, Gitlab, Hancom Office and Zammad.</p>
