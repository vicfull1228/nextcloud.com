			<p>With Nextcloud 9.0, you can seamlessly collaborate on files and folders with others, <em>add comments</em> while working on files and <em>organize files via tags</em>. Keep an eye on what happens to your files through the <em>activity feed</em>, available in the Activity app, through RSS or in the Nextcloud client apps. <em>Notifications</em> will pop up with calendar invitations or when files are shared. The Nextcloud community developed a wide variety of applications bringing additional collaborative capabilities like email handling, calendar and contacts, and more.</p>

			<h2>Ultimate Scalability</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="featurewrapper">
			<p>You want Nextcloud to get your files quickly and smoothly, even if it is serving hundreds of thousands of users or sharing terabytes of data. With Nextcloud deployed in increasingly larger installations, scalability and performance are more important than ever. Nextcloud has collaborated with large Nextcloud users like research institutes CERN and AARNet to bring the scalability of Nextcloud to a new level. Nextcloud has improved key areas such as storage and sharing functionality to deliver petabytes of data to hundreds of thousands of users.</p>

			<div class="col-md-7 featureblock">
				<img class="thumbnail" alt="documentation" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/assets/img/features/api.png" />
				<h3 class="featuretitle">New Storage API</h3></br>
				<p class="featuredesc">To be compatible with as many backend storage systems as possible, Nextcloud is designed to store all file metadata in the Nextcloud database. This includes information like sharing information, file IDs and more. As the database can become a bottleneck in extremely large systems, offloading these file handling activities and metadata to an alternative location can improve performance, allowing the same hardware to scale to support even more users.  This is particularly useful for very large instances. It also enables the integration of existing storage capabilities like version support.</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">In addition to improved scalability and integration, the new storage API also enables Nextcloud to leverage storage that has is unheard of in file access solutions - such as tape. Nextcloud allows access to files on any kind of storage with the same frictionless user experience.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5 featureblock">
				<img class="thumbnail" alt="faster" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/assets/img/features/sharing2.png" />
				<h3 class="featuretitle">Updated Sharing</h3></br>
				<p class="featuredesc">With Nextcloud you can share with whomever you like, choosing conditions and permissions for the recipient. Nextcloud 9.0 introduces a rewritten and simplified sharing model, avoiding recursive sharing conflicts and making sure it is always clear who is the owner of a file and who has access to it. Re-shares by people who received shared files (and were allowed to re-share) are now visible to and under control of the file owner.</p>

				    <li>Automatic database, trash and version cleanups don't cause system wide slow-downs anymore</li>
				    <li>With certain mail server configurations, setting the correct sender address now works</li>
