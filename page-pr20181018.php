<h1>Nextcloud and Collabora bring deeper integration to document collaboration</h1>
<h3>Integration adds previews, image insertion and sidebar with comments and sharing options</h3>

<p><em>UK/Germany October 18 2018.</em> The Nextcloud and Collabora teams announce they have developed deeper integration, setting the stage for easier and more efficient browser based collaboration for teams who need to create and share documents, spreadsheets, presentations and more. The improvements allow direct insertion of images from Nextcloud in documents, showing other people who are editing the file and integrating the Nextcloud file sidebar with Collabora Online. The sidebar gives users access to the sharing settings, comments, earlier file versions and the file activity overview.</p>

<blockquote>These great improvements, and the tighter integration with Collabora Online provides productivity and efficiency benefits for our mutual customers,</blockquote>

said Michael Meeks, General Manager, Collabora Productivity

<blockquote>We look forward to building further on our strong partnership.</blockquote>

<p>These improvements set the stage for further integration. With the ability to start a chat or video call or sent an email to any of the participants in the call, share documents in a publicly shared chat to make it available to all participants and more, organizational borders disappear.</p>

<blockquote>We see daily at customers that being able to seamlessly communicate and get work done on one platform is key to the productivity of modern, interdisciplinary teams,</blockquote>
said Frank Karlitschek, CEO of Nextcloud GmbH.

<blockquote>Nextcloud and Collabora deliver on that in an unprecedented way.</blockquote>

<p>The changes are available right now in the app that can be downloaded from the Nextcloud app store, in combination with the latest release of Collabora Online. Further work is planned which will be reflected in future releases later this year.</p>
